# Encode Gene Ontology terms using their definitions or positions on the GO tree.

## The methods applied are: 
* Defintion encoder
  1. BiLSTM 
  2. ELMo
  3. Transformer based on BERT strategy. 
* Position encoder
  4. GCN
  5. Onto2vec

### The key objective is to capture the relatedness of GO terms by encoding them into similar vectors.
